### About the project - intentions and future objectives -

I am a 3-year undergraduate, Pre-Medical student living in Philadelphia, USA. I have recently started to appreciate science, especially these almost finished years as an undergraduate student.  

When I first started to think about -WeStillAlive- I was reentering my country of origin, Italy, from Nairobi, Kenya.

After about two months spent in Nairobi working in a private clinic in central Kawangware, one of Africas biggest slums in Kenya, I let grow the idea in my head that my life could never be the same after that experience. To fund-raise and devote every single effort applied in this blog to people I saw with my own eyes is what I wanted to do mostly.

So, I started -WeStillAlive- to share personal experiences, such as the one in Nairobi, and facts, such as interesting topics in scholastic subjects, that have companied me throughout my studies at TJU, maintaining a global mindset with an emphasis in science and medicine.

In summary, with -WeStillAlive-, I want to share the content of actuality and familiarity giving a scientific point of view to well-understood subjects let sometimes lay into superficiality. My goal is to create a pleasant atmosphere in which one person's interest and curiosity can come meet science and its educative objective. With that, I want to engage people and science from a more global perspective, a place to place approach that goes from Nairobi to Italy back to Philadelphia where I currently study.

I truly believe science and medicine will be at the need of a broader approach, a global system that can come together for the benefit of one public healthcare community.
