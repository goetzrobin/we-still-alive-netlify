### About the Project - Intentions and Future Objectives -

I am a 3-year undergraduate, Pre-Medical student living in Philadelphia, USA. I have recently started to appreciate science, especially these almost finished years as an undergraduate student.  

When I first started to think about -WeStillAlive- I was reentering my country of origin, Italy, from Nairobi, Kenya.

After about two months spent in Nairobi working in a private clinic in central Kawangware, one of Africas biggest slums in Kenya, I let grow the idea in my head that my life could never be the same after that experience. To fund-raise and devote every single effort applied in this blog to people I saw with my own eyes is what I wanted to do mostly.

So, I started -WeStillAlive- to share personal experiences, such as the one in Nairobi, and facts, such as interesting topics in scholastic subjects, that have companied me throughout my studies at TJU, maintaining a global mindset with an emphasis in science and medicine.

In summary, with -WeStillAlive-, I want to share the content of actuality and familiarity giving a scientific point of view to well-understood subjects let sometimes lay into superficiality. My goal is to create a pleasant atmosphere in which one person's interest and curiosity can come meet science and its educative objective. With that, I want to engage people and science from a more global perspective, a place to place approach that goes from Nairobi to Italy back to Philadelphia where I currently study. 

We still alive is a Charity-Leaned website whose intentions are to involve many interested-in-science individuals and devote their attention and help to the people most in need in the area of Nairobi, Kenya.  

I truly believe science and medicine will be at the need of a broader approach, a global system that can come together for the benefit of one public healthcare community.

### Michele Ganz - Author

I am from Italy. So you may already assume things about me, such as that I drink coffee excessively, that I love pizza and pasta, that are simply true for any Italian person you have known or met some time ago. I have to say sincerely that I do not diverge much from that version of an Italian individual that you might have guessed. I like what is said about us, what seems to be of Italian origin, costume and tradition only, but there is more than that that can be said about a person of our kind. 

I indeed consider very interesting the science that surrounds us. I find compelling the every-day scientific novel made of those actions that set the basis of life on earth. To go up and down the stairs to your office or perform on a marathon race aiming for the first positions, those actions might trigger common muscle functions but everything that remains still hidden and specific, like the need to be biochemically perfect to result in the completion of this healthy action, is what fascinates me.

I am Michele Ganz, a graduating 3/year student in Pre Medical studies whose hopes are to become a cardiothoracic surgeon. When I am not in my room studying, I love to play soccer, a sport that has been more than a hobby for me when I was younger. I am currently part of the soccer athletic program at the university where I currently study, indeed. I like also to explore the city of philadelphia and have fun with my friends.
