### About the project - intentions and future objectives - 

I am a last year undergraduate, Pre-Medical student living in Philadelphia, USA. I have recently started to appreciate science, especially my first three years as a university student in America. 

I started -WeStillAlive- to share perosnal experiences as well as facts that have companied me throughout my studies at TJU. 

When I first started to think about -WeStillAlive- I was reentering my country of origin, Italy, from Nairobi, Kenya. After about two months spent in Nairobi working in a private clinic in central Kawangware, one of Africas biggest slums in Kenya, I let grow the ideas in my head hardly provoked after time to finally come up with one to me unique purpose; to fund-raise and devote every single effort applied in this blog to people I sow not even able to afford a fifty cents vaccine. 

Today with -WeStillAlive-, I want to share content of actuality and familiarity giving a scientific point of view to well understood subjects let sometimes lay into superficiality. My goal is to create a pleasant atmosphere in which one person interest and curiosity can come meet science and its educative objective.
