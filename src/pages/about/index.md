### About the project - intentions and future objectives -

I am a 3 year undergraduate, Pre-Medical student living in Philadelphia, USA. I have recently started to appreciate science, especially these almost finished  years as a undergraduate student. 

When I first started to think about -WeStillAlive- I was reentering my country of origin, Italy, from Nairobi, Kenya. 

After about two months spent in Nairobi working in a private clinic in central Kawangware, one of Africas biggest slums in Kenya, I let grow the idea in my head that my life could never be the same as before after that time spent in Africa.

To fund-raise and devote every single effort applied in this blog to people I sow with my own eyes is what I wanted to do mostly. 

So, I started -WeStillAlive- to share personal experiences, such as the one in Nairobi, and facts, such as interesting topics in scolastic subjects, that have companied me throughout my studies at TJU, mantaining a global mindset with emphasis in science and medicine. 

In summary, with -WeStillAlive-, I want to share content of actuality and familiarity giving a scientific point of view to well understood subjects let sometimes lay into superficiality. My goal is to create a pleasant atmosphere in which one person interest and curiosity can come meet science and its educative objective. With that, I want to engage people and science in a more global prospective, place to place from Nairobi to Italy back to Philadelphia where I study. 

I truly belive science and medicine will be at need of a broader approach, a global approach that lastly can come together for the benefit of the public health environment.
