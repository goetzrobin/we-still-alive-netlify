    I seek solid reasons to better explain the beauty of the every-day
    unpredictability of life through scientific-related evidence that as well
    those arise from the studies at Thomas Jefferson University and the African
    experience in Kawangware, Kenya. As well, this project is a place useful to
    me to overcome the difficulties of studying material not yet enjoyed at the
    university level. "

    to the readers to expand their curiosity, to embrace a new way of
    approaching commonality of familiar events that not always find space to
    simple answers, and to see science as an educator with interests and
    satisfactions. The blog aims to involve readers to agree, dispute, engage
    and question the content of science with the writer (Michele) to go to share
    the common objective of Helping the unmoving needs required in developing
    populations. Let us debate with science and agree for Helping others. "

        ### Kawangware: To Help The Rooted Need of an Impoverished Sanitation


        Kawangware, a residential area in Nairobi, Kenya, is to knowledge and experience a place of both fortune and sadness.


        The population living in Kawangware, with studied and supported evidence, seems to be particularly prone to be successful in sports related to high velocities, such as long-distance run competitions. Genetics and environmental (diet) factors present in this area play an important role in determining the success of these athletes. Olympians but also marathon famous winners in running events are known to be coming from this area, indeed.


        By reminding me of what seems to be unique and astonishing of this population, however, I have to unwillingly say that this attraction shades into uncertainty and sadness also. Kawangware is indeed one of the most impoverished locations of the whole African continent. Sanitation in this area is highly inadequate and hardly meets the basic standards of hygiene and water security.


        Kawangware is to date the location where WeStillAlive is mostly prone to consider to help and provide support to water and sanitaton (toilets and sewering systems) services to improve monitoring infrastructures quality and operational services to water purity and sustainability. Promoting constumers demand and infrastructures renowation such as old water pipes, are key solution but also challenges to the issue which requires careful attention. 


        Besides its beauty and uniqueness, this region needs change and change needs intentions. WeStillAlive considers population health of this location important, and through improvement in sanitation and water supply, change is no more a need but a possibility. Lets try to help.
