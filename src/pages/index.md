    University, the home of Sidney Kimmel Medical College, with an interest in
    medicine and hopes of continuing my career as a cardio-thoracic pediatric
    surgeon. With WeStillAlive - The Blog-, I seek solid reasons to better
    explain the beauty of the every-day unpredictability of life through
    scientific-related evidence that as well those arise from the studies at
    Thomas Jefferson University and the African experience in Kawangware, Kenya.
    As well, this blog is a place useful to me to overcome the difficulties of
    studying various and at times overwhelming material at the university level.

    the readers to expand their curiosity, to embrace a new way of approaching
    commonality of familiar events that not always find space to simple answers,
    and to see science as an educator with interests and in one particular
    developing area in Kenya. The blog aims to involve readers to agree,
    dispute, and question the content of science with the writer to go to share
    the common objective of helping the unmoving needs required in developing

        ### Sustainable Services of Faces Disposal and Water Quality: A Crucial
        Change


        Maai Mahiu and Maasai Mara, both northern and weatern areas  respectively from Nairobi, Kenya, a place to knowledge and experience a place of both fortune and sadness.


        The population living in those two areas (and more eventually), with supported evidence, seem to be particularly prone to be successful in sports related to high velocities, such as long-distance run competitions. Genetics and environmental (diet) factors present in this area play an important role in determining the success of these athletes. Olympians but also marathon famous winners in running events are known to be coming from this area, indeed.                                       By reminding me of what seems to be unique and astonishing of this population, however, I have to unwillingly say that this attraction shades into uncertainty and sadness also. Maai Mahiu and Maasai Mara are indeed one of the most impoverished locations of the whole African continent. Sanitation in this area is highly inadequate and hardly meets the basic standards of hygiene and water security.  Maai Mahiu and Maasai Mara are to date the areas where *WeStillAlive* focuses its target on and mostly prone its energies to help and provide water services to improve monitoring infrastructures quality and operational structures to water purity and sustainability. Promoting consumer demand and infrastructure renovation such as old water pipes and feces disposal settings, are key solutions but also challenges to the issue which requires careful attention. *WeStillAlive* aims to give this attention and share the challenges and the results obtained with hard work, dedication, and perseverance. The targeted population for this fund-raising organization are the Maai Mahiu and Maasai Community. It is of crucial importance to them to provide purified water as they are most prone to suffer from diseases (diarrheal disease) caused by water dirtiness and contamination. Even more important are the consequences of water purification, storage, and distribution. Individuals potentially will see imprivements in the prevention of and recovery rate from local infections, and find time for a wellestalished education in scholastic settings (chilren under the age of five). 


        Besides its beauty and uniqueness of talented running athletes, this region needs change and change needs intentions. *WeStillAlive* considers population healthcare of this location important, and through improvement in sanitation and water supply, change is no more a need but a possibility.
