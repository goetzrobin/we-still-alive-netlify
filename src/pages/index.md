  description: "I am an undergraduate, Pre-Medical student at Thomas Jefferson
    University, the home of Sidney Kimmel Medical College, with an interest in
    medicine and hopes of becoming a cardiothoracic surgeon. I seek solid
    reasons to better explain the beauty of the every-day unpredictability of
    life through scientific medical-related evidence that as well those arise
    from personal actual studies and experiences. "

    We Still Alive is a place that shares a content of actuality of sometime
    questioned subjects let lay though into superficiality and gives a
    scientific approach to that to try to answer them.


    It is a place for me useful to overcome the difficulties of studying material not yet enjoyed and fun. 


    It is the final and most important place prone to donate persons most in need opportunities never had before.
