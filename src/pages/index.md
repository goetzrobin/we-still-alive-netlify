  description: "I am an undergraduate, Pre-Medical student at Thomas Jefferson
    University, the home of Sidney Kimmel Medical College, with an interest in
    medicine and hopes of becoming a cardiothoracic surgeon. I seek solid
    reasons to better explain the beauty of the every-day unpredictability of
    life through scientific-related evidence that as well those arise from the
    studies at Thomas Jefferson University and the African experience in Kikuyu,
    Kenya. "

    We Still Alive is a place that shares the content of Kenyan actuality of
    questioned events and thoughts that lay into superficiality and gives a
    scientific approach to that to try to explain them. 


    It is a place useful to overcome the difficulties of studying material not yet enjoyed at the university level. 


    It is the final and most important place prone to donate opportunities never had before to persons most in need in Kenya.
