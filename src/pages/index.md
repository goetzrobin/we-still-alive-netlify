  description: "I am an undergraduate, Pre-Medical student at Thomas Jefferson
    University, the home of Sidney Kimmel Medical College with an interest in
    medicine and cardiothoracic-pediatric surgery. I seek solid reasons to
    better explain the every-day miracle of life through medical-related
    evidence that as well those arise from personal actual studies and
    experiences. "

    We Still Alive is a place that share stories.

    Sometimes own stories. Sometimes other people's stories. Sometimes just a never-questioned situation that scientifically that can be explained. 


    It is a place for me useful to overcome the difficulty of studying material not yet enjoyed and fun. 


    It is the final and most important place prone to donate persons most in need opportunities never had before.
