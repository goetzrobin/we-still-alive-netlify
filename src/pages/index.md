  description: "I am an undergraduate, Pre-Medical student at Thomas Jefferson
    University, the home of Sidney Kimmel Medical College, with an interest in
    medicine and hopes of becoming a cardiothoracic surgeon. With WeStillAlive,
    I seek solid reasons to better explain the beauty of the every-day
    unpredictability of life through scientific-related evidence that as well
    those arise from the studies at Thomas Jefferson University and the African
    experience in Kikuyu, Kenya. As well, this project is a place useful to me
    to overcome the difficulties of studying material not yet enjoyed at the
    university level. "
