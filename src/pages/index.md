    University, the home of Sidney Kimmel Medical College, with an interest in
    medicine and hopes of continuing my career for the benefit of the
    Philadelphia community and the one across the ocean (Italy and Kenya). With
    WeStillAlive - The Blog-, I seek solid reasons to better explain the beauty
    of the every-day unpredictability of life through scientific-related
    evidence that as well those arise from the studies at Thomas Jefferson
    University and the African experience in Kawangware, Kenya. As well, this
    project is a place useful to me to overcome the difficulties of studying
    various and at times overwhelming material at the university level. "

  text: The articles that will be posted on this website regularly are a chance to
    the readers to expand their curiosity, to embrace a new way of approaching
    commonality of familiar events that not always find space to simple answers,
    and to see science as an educator with interests and satisfactions. The blog
    aims to involve readers to agree, dispute, and question the content of
    science with the writer to go to share the common objective of helping the
    unmoving needs required in developing populations. It is a chance to raise,
    together, the money necessary to support the mission that WeStillAlive
    believes in.

        ### Sustainable Services of Faces Disposal and Water Quality: A Crucial
        Change


        Kawangware, a residential area in Nairobi, Kenya, is to knowledge and experience a place of both fortune and sadness.


        The population living in Kawangware, with studied and supported evidence, seems to be particularly prone to be successful in sports related to high velocities, such as long-distance run competitions. Genetics and environmental (diet) factors present in this area play an important role in determining the success of these athletes. Olympians but also marathon famous winners in running events are known to be coming from this area, indeed.                                       By reminding me of what seems to be unique and astonishing of this population, however, I have to unwillingly say that this attraction shades into uncertainty and sadness also. Kawangware is indeed one of the most impoverished locations of the whole African continent. Sanitation in this area is highly inadequate and hardly meets the basic standards of hygiene and water security.  Kawangware is to date the location where *WeStillAlive* is mostly prone to consider to help and provide support to water and sanitation (toilets and sewering systems) services to improve monitoring infrastructures quality and operational services to water purity and sustainability for toilets operative success. Promoting consumer demand and infrastructure renovation such as old water pipes and feces disposal settings, are key solutions but also challenges to the issue which requires careful attention. *WeStillAlive* aims to give this attention and share the challenges and the results obtained with hard work, dedication, and perseverance. The targeted population for this fund-raising campaign and foundation are particular children living in orphanages in the area of Kawangware. It is of crucial importance to them to provide purified water and enough hygiene and health care security as they are most prone to suffer from diseases (diarrheal disease) caused by water dirtiness and contamination of animal and human faces.


        Besides its beauty and uniqueness of talented running athletes, this region needs change and change needs intentions. *WeStillAlive* considers children's health of this location important, and through improvement in sanitation and water supply, change is no more a need but a possibility.
