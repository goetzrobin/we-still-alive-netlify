    University, the home of Sidney Kimmel Medical College, with an interest in
    medicine and hopes of becoming a cardiothoracic surgeon. With WeStillAlive,
    I seek solid reasons to better explain the beauty of the every-day
    unpredictability of life through scientific-related evidence that as well
    those arise from the studies at Thomas Jefferson University and the African
    experience in Kikuyu, Kenya. As well, this project is a place useful to me
    to overcome the difficulties of studying material not yet enjoyed at the
    university level. "

        ### Kawangware: To Help The Rooted Need of an Impoverished Sanitation  


        Kawangware, a residential area in Nairobi, Kenya, is to knowledge and experience a place of fortune and uncertainty.


        The population living in Kawangware, with studied and supported evidence, seems to be particularly prone to be successful in sports related to high velocities, such as long-distance run competitions. Genetics and environmental (diet) factors present in this area play an important role in determining the success of these athletes. Olympians but also marathon famous winners in running events are known to be coming from this area, indeed.


        By reminding me of what seems to be unique and astonishing of this population, however, I have to unwillingly say that this attraction shades into uncertainty and sadness also. Kawangware is indeed one of the most impoverished locations of the whole African continent. Sanitation in this area is highly inadequate and hardly meets the basic standards of hygiene and water security.


        Kawangware is to date the location where WeStillAlive is mostly prone to consider to help and sustainably provide support to the population in need. Toilets and sewering systems are required and the difficult solution to the issue.


        Besides its beauty and uniqueness, this region needs change and change needs intentions. WeStillAlive considers population health of this location important, and through improvement in sanitation, change is no more a need but a possibility, and perhaps more beauty would be seen instead and more competition could win again challenges no more sport-related but of living concerns.
