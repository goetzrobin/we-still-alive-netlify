description: The genotype ACTN3 known for the genetic relation to high athletic
  performance due to its role in coding for a type II skeletal-muscle protein,
  the alfa-actinin-3 (1,2,3), gave a reason for this ethnicity to be part of a
  bigger picture than one underestimated country downfall.

*“I was running home, if that can somehow expressameanof safety and shelter, of food unmissed and worm infinite showers. I was running another race with time, feeling the ground beneathmy feet and it was different, softer;almostincomplete, and the ground wasthought to beold and wreaked. More genuine the air was running through my nose vestibulesinstead, and I thought I could win this racejustone more time:”*



In November 2019, I was in Kenya, Kikuyu, when I first noticed that to learn how to run has a meaning that goes beyond an Olympic race or a major marathon win.

For the first time, I got the chance to see the endurance and the power coexisting in the infinite physiological gesture of nature’sgift developedwithin a multicellular organism.Aswell,I could seethe nurture of that same organismover onesingle environmentraised up toenhance thechance to wina running raceover and over again.

The population I got to know living in Kikuyu,the African Bantugroupthat populates the western area of Nairobi,remained silent of the fact that beyond a dramatic healthcaresetting that as welldefinedoneoffdeveloping socio-economic character, they belong to an ethnic group known for acomplex that is not socio-economicor healthcare related, buthas a word to say in genetics.

The genotype ACTN3 known for thegeneticrelationto high athletic performancedue to its role in coding for a type II skeletal-muscle protein,thealfa-actin-3(1,2,3), gavea reason forthisethnicity to be part of a bigger picturethanoneunderestimatedcountrydownfall.

ThisspecificKenyan characteristics part of thiscentral Africanpopulationwas, andstillnot fully understood,studiedfor its genetic lean to favor highathleticismand influence onhighrunningexecutions(power and endurance).

On a broader scale, it washypothesizedthat theproteinsalfa-actinin-3,majorcomponentofthe Z line of sarcomeres,where they as welllink to the actin thin filament presentedin one individualmyofibrils,synthesized from the coding gene(stop codon)ACTN3,R577X,playedamajor roleinathletes that performs withforce athigh velocity (2).Overrevealedevidence, the alfa-actinin-3was confirmed tobe advantageous due toits outstandingsusceptibility toabsorb or transmitforceat the Z lineduring contraction (2).

Studiesshowedthatthe alfa-actinin-3-deficientgenotype (1)present inindividualsof theAfrican Bantu population(Kikuyu ethnic group included)waslow(<1%)(2)comparedto theEuropean and Asian populationswhere the deficient wasseen to be higher (18 and 25%each)(2).Moreover, itwas hypothesizedthatalfa-actinin-3is directly linked toimproveperformance inAfrican (Bantu)athletes inevents that involvestrength (the muscle generation force),endurance (theathleteanaerobic effort over time),andpower (the interaction of force and velocity in muscle contraction)(1,3).

In specific,maintaining abroadercontext,thepotentialcodon originatingfromapolymorphism(the presence of genetic variation within a population)was seen incompleted research tolead to a stop codon instead of anarginineprotein(R)(2).Then, theRR genotype was hypothesizedtobe beneficial in high sprinting ability and strength, while the XX genotype with lowerphysicalabilities (still concerning athletic performances)(1).It was confirmed through several studies, that all Olympian athletes havethe R allele of ACTN3 present, supporting the fact that this genetic variant may highly play a role in this power-oriented sports(2).

In studies that showed additional correlation to the performance of athletes around the world, the 577R allele was seen to be present in higher frequency (sprinters mostly) in African descent populations compared to other populations around the world, such as Caucasians (of European origin) (2,3).

Although proven by experts and analysts ofadvancedgenetic competence, the correlations ingenetictermsnot always reachedmedical-related,rooted, andcomplete evidenceinsupportingthethesiscited in this text.Indeed, it has not yet been fully investigated the complete relation between genes and their status ofdecisively dictateworld class competitor’swinsordefeats(2).Particularly, it is not still sure how genetics works toroleperformance inamateur athletewhodo not contendbothnationally andinternationally(3).

Therefore, thedeficiency inalfa-actinin-3wassustained to reduce performance in high exerciseevents.Polymorphism was confirmed to lead to that deficiency of protein that in a more complicated way, modifies the athletic aspect of a performer athlete to better succeedor notinathleticcompetitions,such as the Olympic games or marathons.The 577R allele therefore was confirmed (2) toshow important linkagesto force at high velocity more generically.

TheRR genotypewere genetic factors seen more often in populations of the African continent, such as theBantu population living inKikuyu, Nairobi.In addition to that, theethnic groupwasconfirmedto be more suitedto competeandsucceedin sportslinked toenergeticskeletal musclecontractionsthatincrease quality in the athlete performance, such as sprint (2).

Simply because genetics here plays an important role in performance, it has notstillbeen fully comprehended,and, in some cases, the correlation between ACTN3 and other genetic aspects (such as the ACE genotypenot explained in this text) were not considered determinant of the success of sprinters in powerand endurance-orientedcompetitions (3).

As the genetic aspect of an individual’s performance gained importance over years, besides the countless studies completed and somehow yet not fully understood and explained, the role of genetics in today’s sports is becoming popular evidence available to athletes, trainers, and sport clubs with a potentialto inform and influencefuture performances andathlete’ssuccess.

Genetics asthe one individual’sinheritedpredispositionability, it is ofnatureimportance. Thenature and nurture discourse in this context is inevitable. It must be taken into consideration that the combination perhaps of oneathlete’slifestyle, optimal diet and practice, and genetics canaltogetherlean to a one possible common denominator of athletic success. The environmentthereforeinfluences traits that mayas wellfavorathleticperformances, and that varies between sports,and that must be remembered.

While I was living in Kikuyu, Nairobi, during the winter of 2019 I was still unaware of the enormous athletic abilities that the Bantu population were capable of having and not showing, at least to me.

The power of nature may be sometimes one-sided, as it cannot be fully understood andimmediatelyintroduced to peoplein person, and to noticed itbe expressed out physical characteristicsmayrequireadditionaltime.

The athletic aspect of the Bantu population come to my mind clearer, as I remember some of the fact that I sowthereand have made me write this brief paragraph today.

In Kikuyu, perhaps the power of running fast is not seen as we all see it relevant only in world wide competitions, such as the Olympics,or clearer in European marathons (Berlin, Paris) where the results just talks themselves in favor of this population, but as importancein theeverydayactions of thepersons. And that one single trait is so important to them, it gets to my mind clearertodaythat it is not about arunningrace but simply about life the fundamental origin of genetics. Evolution, as we remember Darwin theory, are modificationsover time of common features (genotype dictates phenotype) that descend from one older individual, and it changes due to many factors, that, for sure, are related to the circumstances (environment) the Bantu populationlived upon and had todevelopin order to “survive”over time.

The chances that genetics (theRR genotypecoded ACTN3, 577R) in the Bantu population (Kikuyu) revealed to light their incredible skills to run fast and succeed at high-level environments was hypothesized to be, to a certain extent, fundamental. The environment (diet and trainings) as well played an important part in this process to support their skills.

As Hippocrates noted, the requisitesforan individual’s“positive health,”that might here extend to one’s likelihood to succeed in power-oriented exhibitions,descend from factors that varies between heritability(genetic predisposition)and environment (food and exercise)(4).And it was agreed that what sustained by “the father of Medicine” might be the final formula of athletic success.



*“As I was keeping to run down the hill to my home, I was looking around the surroundings. I could see no power and athletic-oriented skills, but I was blind to see the truth indeed.And one person running faster than me of course, said hello to me while becoming just onedot to me far away in front of sight.”*
