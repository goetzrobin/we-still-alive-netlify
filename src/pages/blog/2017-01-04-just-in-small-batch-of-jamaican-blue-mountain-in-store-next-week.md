*“I was running home, if that can somehow express a mean of safety and shelter, of food unmissed and worm infinite showers. I was running another race with time, feeling the ground beneath my feet and it was different, softer; almost incomplete, and the ground was thought to be old and wreaked. More genuine the air was running through my nose vestibules instead, and I thought I could win this race just one more time:”*

In November 2019, I was in Kenya, Kikuyu, when I first noticed that to learning how to run has a meaning that goes beyond an Olympic race or a major marathon win.

For the first time, I got the chance to see the endurance and the power coexisting in the infinite physiological gesture of nature’s gift developed within a multicellular organism. I could also see the nurture of that same organism over one single environment raised up to enhance the chance to win a running race over and over again.

The people I got to know to live in Kikuyu, the African Bantu group that populates the western area of Nairobi, remained silent of the fact that beyond a reliable healthcare setting that as well defined one of developing socio-economic character, they belong to an ethnic group known for a complex that is not socio-economic or healthcare-related but has a word to say in genetics.

The genotype ACTN3 known for the genetic relation to high athletic performance due to its role in coding for a type II skeletal-muscle protein, the α-actinin-3 (1,2,3), gave a reason for this ethnicity to be part of a bigger picture than one underestimated downfall in the country.

The specific Kenyan characteristics that were a part of this central African population were studied for its genetic lean to favor high athleticism and influence on high running executions (power and endurance).

On a broader scale, it was hypothesized that the proteins α-actinin-3, the major component of the Z line of sarcomeres, where they also a link to the actin thin filament presented in one individual myofibril, synthesized from the coding gene (stop codon) ACTN3, R577X, played a major role in athletes that performs with force at high velocity (2). Over revealed evidence, the α-actinin-3 was confirmed to be advantageous due to its outstanding susceptibility to absorb or transmit force at the Z line during contraction (2).

Studies showed that the α-actinin-3-deficient genotype (1) present in individuals of the African Bantu population (Kikuyu ethnic group included) was low (<1%) (2) compared to the European and Asian populations where the deficient was seen to be higher (18 and 25% each) (2). Moreover, it was hypothesized that α-actinin-3 is directly linked to improving performance in African (Bantu) athletes in events that involve strength (the muscle generation force), endurance (the athlete anaerobic effort over time), and power (the interaction of force and velocity in muscle contraction) (1,3).

Specifically, maintaining a broader context, the potential codon originating from a polymorphism (the presence of genetic variation within a population) was seen in completed research to lead to a stop codon instead of an arginine protein (R) (2). Then, the RR genotype was hypothesized to be beneficial in high sprinting ability and strength, while the XX genotype with lower physical abilities (still concerning athletic performances) (1). It was confirmed through several studies, that all Olympian athletes have the R allele of ACTN3 present, supporting the fact that this genetic variant may highly play a role in this power-oriented sports (2).

In studies that showed additional correlation to the performance of athletes around the world, the 577R allele was seen to be present in higher frequency (sprinters mostly) in African descent populations compared to other populations around the world, such as Caucasians (of European origin) (2,3).

Although proven by experts and analysts of advanced genetic competence, the correlations in genetic terms did not always reach medical-related, rooted, and complete evidence in supporting the thesis cited in this text. Indeed, the complete relation between genes and their status of decisively dictate has not been investigated fully, world-class competitor’s wins or defeats (2). Particularly, it is still not sure how genetics work to role performance in amateur athletes who do not contend both nationally and internationally (3).

Therefore, the deficiency in α-actinin-3 was sustained to reduce performance in high exercise events. Polymorphism was confirmed to lead to that deficiency of a protein that in a more complicated way, modifies the athletic aspect of a performer athlete to better succeed or not in athletic competitions, such as the Olympic games or marathons. The 577R allele, therefore, was confirmed (2) to show important linkages to force at high velocity more generically.

The RR genotype were genetic factors seen more often in populations of the African continent, such as the Bantu population living in Kikuyu, Nairobi. In addition, the ethnic group was confirmed to be more suited to compete and succeed in sports linked to energetic skeletal muscle contractions that increase quality in the athlete performance, such as sprint (2).

Simply because genetics here plays an important role in performance, it has not still been fully comprehended, and, in some cases, the correlation between ACTN3 and other genetic aspects (such as the ACE genotype not explained in this text) were not considered determinants of the success of sprinters in power and endurance-oriented competitions (3).

As the genetic aspect of an individual’s performance gained importance over years, besides the countless studies completed and somehow yet not fully understood and explained, the role of genetics in today’s sports is becoming popular evidence available to athletes, trainers, and sports clubs with a potential to inform and influence future performances and athlete’s success.

Genetics is the one individual’s inherited predisposition ability, it is of "nature" importance. Nature and nurture discourse in this context is inevitable. It must be taken into consideration that the combination perhaps of one athlete’s lifestyle, optimal diet and practice, and genetics can altogether lean to one possible common denominator of athletic success. The environment, therefore, influences traits that may as well favor athletic performances, and that varies between sports, and that must be remembered.

While I was living in Kikuyu, Nairobi, during the winter of 2019 I was still unaware of the enormous athletic abilities that the Bantu population was capable of having, while it wasn’t always noticeable to me.

The power of nature maybe sometimes one-sided, as it cannot be fully understood and immediately introduced to people in person, and to noticed it be expressed out physical characteristics may require additional time.

The athletic aspect of the Bantu population comes to my mind in a clearer way, as I remember some of the facts that I sow there and have made me write this brief paragraph today.

In Kikuyu, perhaps the power of running fast is not seen as we all see it relevant only in worldwide competitions, such as the Olympics, or clearer in European marathons (Berlin, Paris) where the results just talk themselves in favor of this population, but as important in the everyday actions of the persons. And that one single trait is so important to them, it gets to my mind clearer today that it is not about a running race but simply about life the fundamental origin of genetics. Evolution, as we remember Darwin theory, are modifications over time of common features (genotype dictates phenotype) that descend from one older individual, and it changes due to many factors, that, for sure, are related to the circumstances (environment) the Bantu population lived upon and had to develop in order to “survive” over time.

The chances that genetics (the RR genotype coded ACTN3, 577R) in the Bantu population (Kikuyu) were revealed to show their incredible skills to run fast and succeed at high-level environments were hypothesized to be, to a certain extent, fundamental. The environment (diet and training) as well played an important part in this process to support their skills.

As Hippocrates noted, the requisites for an individual’s “positive health,” that might extend here to one’s likelihood to succeed in power-oriented exhibitions, descend from factors that vary between heritability (genetic predisposition) and environment (food and exercise) (4). And it was agreed that what sustained by “the father of Medicine” might be the final formula of athletic success.

*“As I was keeping to run down the hill to my home, I was looking around the surroundings. I could see no power and athletic-oriented skills, but I was blind to see the truth indeed. And one person running faster than me of course, said hello while becoming just one dot to be far away in front of the sight.”*
