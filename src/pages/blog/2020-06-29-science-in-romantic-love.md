Elizabeth Barrett Browning, one of the major English poets of the 1800s, about love once wrote (Sonnet 43):

How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height 
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight 
For the ends of being and ideal grace.
I love thee to the level of every day’s
Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.
I love thee freely, as men strive for right.
I love thee purely, as they turn from praise.
I love thee with the passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith. 
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath, 
Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose, 
I shall but love thee better after death. 

* Elizabeth Barrett Browning
  Sonnets from the Portuguese (Sonnet 43)

Romantic Love. For many decades, writers, poets, philosophers, and artists of any genre (in music, films, and theaters) have tried to explore romantic love to give an idea to which one individual (a lover, a partner) could rely upon to understand, describe, and give answers to the emotions perceived when transmitted down deeply into the whole experience of obsession, pleasure, arousal, Romantic Love. 
From the amour Courtois, the comprehension of passionate attractions, sexual desire, and even more, developed to go to flow into a myriad of modern love-related concepts, psychological understandings, including therapies and new ideas of what to love means and is about. 

Romantic love, different from platonic love (love between two persons but with no sexual relation) and other typologies of love not cited here for simplicity, seems to have started to evolve some millions of years ago (4.4 million years ago accordingly) \[1]. Thought to be seen and developed from early hominin prehistory in specific mammalian systems of physical attraction, today’s Romantic love has prolonged and intensified over time and become a collection of activities associated with emotions needed for reproduction and survival \[2]. A need that since millions of years ago drove individuals to focus the attention on just one other individual (monogamy) so to initiate the process of reproducing \[3]. 
To date, romantic love is defined as the pleasurable affection, sexual attraction, and passionate love and sentiment of intimacy shared between two partners, whether lovers or beloved. 

Although writers and philosophers have been in search, and perhaps found, for longer periods the definition and meaning of love, in recent years, other fields of study have stepped in to try to explain the hidden secret of love. Today, science shares important evidence on the definition, causes, and intentions of romantic love, along with its restless, endless, and historical properties. 
Romantic love, defined by science is a property shaped by history and development of neuropeptides and neurotransmitters \[2]. Neuroendocrinology has studied the principles behind the acquisition of unpredictable and unprecedented states of emotion-driven by one individual shift of behavior when experienced love (be in love or be loved) \[2].
As a motivational system (the planning and pursuit of a need or objective), studies have shown that romantic love involves the area of the brain associated with motivation and pursuit of pre-planned objectives. So, the need of taking on risky behavior, conduct that shows euphoria, obsessive thinking, emotional dependence, sexual attraction, and possessiveness are all common attitudes that relate to one goal-oriented attitude of the individual that experience this typology of love. 

Although romantic love may have different facets based on the time the relationship started between the partners, researches have shown upfront discoveries on the ultimate explanation of romantic love.
The scientific activity that causes humans to respond in ways to the feeling and perception of love finds roots in the neurological aspect of a person’s anatomy and physiology. The early phase of love, which usually is characterized by feelings of pleasure and searching for behaviors of intimacy, has revealed the neurobiological state of the individuals to be extremely proactive and therefore different than a laterphasecompanionship\[2]. Indeed, in the first year into a relationship, a complex series of computations of the brain that delivers uncontrolled and unexpected behaviors to the individual shows a clear sign of the origin of love \[3]. Anxiety, stress, emotional, and physical dependence are all part of the signs the individual’s behavior shows and undergoes \[3]. Science steps in and explains carefully demonstrating that human behaviors during relationships have a neuroendocrinological precursor. 
For example, the hormones of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, studied through magnetic testing (fMRI), involved in the stress response \[4] are important components of love during the first stage of the relationship and can explain the complex abstract lovers’ emotional gestures. In particular, researches show cortisol to be higher in subjects that intend to improve the social bonding, social contact, and tenderness of the interaction \[2,5]. The activation of the stress response, expressed by cortisol in high percentage in most cases studied, causes the physiological adaptations to the stress response to increases respiratory rate, metabolism, and cardiovascular tone. 
Physiological signs showing off when two partners first start to date can be shortened of breath, palpitations, anxiety, euphoria, and a state of awareness.
These conditions are all associated with the neural and endocrine system function of the individuals that seem to experience love \[4], whether the feeling comes from both or just one of the two. 

The early phase of love between two mates is characterized by the catecholamine (adrenal glands hormone), that functions as a neurotransmitter in the nervous system, norepinephrine that is involved in the loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and modification of the individual’s attention activity \[4] seen in the mate, or both mates, who might experience love.
Still, within this fragment of time of the relationship, recent fMRI visible neuroimaging studies of romantic love, demonstrated the role of dopamine, neurotransmitter, as a precursor to regulating the individual's sexual response, the feeling of pleasure, acquire a reward, focused attention and other physiological stimuli part of the first years of the relationship \[1,2,6]. Those stimuli have been proven to be also associated with traits linked with abuse and behavioral addictions, such as tobacco, cannabis, and alcohol \[1]. 

The activation of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) (a structure found in the midbrain region) was clearly visible, in studies conducted also with fMRI where several and different (in age and experience) individuals were tested, and the linkage of it with romantic love was again proven right. It appears to date, that the VTA activeness is present in the early stage of the relationship but also later on over the years (28 months) \[2]. 
The VTA region is part of the central region of the brain’s reward system and indeed seems to be highly triggered when the action of love takes place. Dopamine(DA)and specific pathways (dopaminergic pathways) appear to be critical to the mechanism that involves pleasure, strong motivation to succeed, passion, despair, and painful memories \[1,2,6]. The studies have therefore shown the important linkage between romantic love and the craving for a reward visible in the most relationship, especially nowadays. 
In the first years into the relation, dopamine plays a role in sexual activity and that can serve as an important act to ensure true love to be strong and everlasting-throughout life. Moreover, the increasing level of testosterone and estrogen activity can increase the release of dopamine that additionally can elevate sexual arousal and steroids \[2]. 

It is of certain importance now to introduce to this incredible mixture of neuropeptides and hormones activity discourse the role of testosterone and estrogen. Testosterone, steroid hormone of the male characteristic system, role the amygdala lateral hypothalamus system’s activity which enhances vasopressin, an ancient peptide molecule pivotal in the action of defense, aggression, attachment and love \[7]. Lately, studies have appeared to prove vasopressin (VP) and oxytocin (OT) being fundamental for body adaptation to emotional situations and romantic attachment \[2,7]. The importance of oxytocin being in the presence of the other peptide VP, at times also DP, to favor social behavior and emotional experiences, such as pair bond and sexual behavior, is critical importance as it turns the relationship into a successful mating process \[1,2,6,7].
In this last explanation of science being in “romantic” love, the components of action between DP, OT, and VP are fundamental to strengthen the relationship and make that last over long periods.

Several brain regions are demonstrated to be also triggered by the motivational system of love, and those are the caudate nucleus (located into the lateral ventricle area of the brain) that plays a role in reward detection and expectations, the ventral pallidum (located in the basal ganglia of the brain) that plays a role in regulating feelings of attachment, and the insular cortex (the portion of the cortex found within the lateral sulcus of the brain) that engages the feeling of pain with the overall sensation of love \[1,2,5,6].

To conclude, it is sustained that love is a yet undiscovered unpredictable sum of events that shifts from emotions to all types of feelings. Experts in the fields of poetry, philosophy, and other artistic studies may argue that there has not been a clear explanation of what romantic love means and accomplishes.

It has been restated that hormones, such as testosterone, plays an important role in sexual craving behaviors. Cortisol, which dictates principles of attraction, peptides, such as VP and OX which are fundamental for individuals and the arousing of feelings of attachment, and other brain areas. The VTA, the amygdala, the ventral pallidum, the caudate nucleus, and the insular cortex which are all important associated mediators of romantic love, help to draw a connection line between science and love showing unique perspective and approach to that. 

However, it is fascinating to see how the human brain responds every time the action of love takes place; how it makes individuals feel the pleasure of a call, the madness of a forgotten message, the urge to talk, and the sufficient sick need of attention from that partner so obstinately desired. 
With this reading, it is seen that romantic love is a motivation. It is a need. It is an addition, perhaps. However, romantic love arose through history from antecedent individual’s experiences and concerns, as it is shown to have similarities in the way the biological mechanism of attraction work in mammalians.
Lately, science has stepped in and debated the since then undebatable topic of romantic love. So as far as science is concerned, romantic love is not a simple infatuation, but a mixture of collective neuroendocrinological activities, of properties that perfectly fits within one individual’s lifespan to make sure love dwells. 

– It has to be remembered that the situation, which described above was the linkage of scientific reasoning with love, can vary between the partner who is male and the one who is female. -
