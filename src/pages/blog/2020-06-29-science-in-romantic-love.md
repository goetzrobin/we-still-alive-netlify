Elizabeth Barrett Browning, one of the major English poets of the eighteen hundred, about love once wrote (Sonnet 43):



How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.\
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height                                                        My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight                                                              For the ends of being and ideal grace.\
I love thee to the level of every day’s\
Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.\
I love thee freely, as men strive for right.\
I love thee purely, as they turn from praise.\
I love thee with the passion put to use\
In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith.                                                             I love thee with a love I seemed to lose\
With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,                                                        Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,                                                             I shall but love thee better after death.

*Sonnetsfrom the Portuguese*(Sonnet 43)



RomanticLove. For many decades, writers, poets, philosophers, and artists of any genera (in music, films and theaters) have try to explore romantic love to give an idea to which one individual(a lover, apartner)could rely to understand, describe, and give answers tothe emotionsperceived when transmitted down deeply into the wholeexperience of obsession, pleasure, arousal, RomanticLove.

From the*amour courtois* to date,the comprehension of passionate attractions, sexual desire and even more developed to go to flow into a myriad of modern love-related concepts, psychological understandings and therapies and new ideas of what to love means and is about.

Romantic love, different from platonic love (love between two persons but with no sexual relation) and other typologies of love not cited here for simplicity, seems to havestarted to evolve some millions of years ago (4.4 million of years ago accordingly) \[1]. Thought to be seen and developed indeedfrom early hominin prehistory in specific mammalian systems of physicalattraction,today’sRomantic lovehas prolonged and intensified over time and become a collection of activities associated with emotions needed for reproduction and survival \[2].A need that since millions of years ago drove individuals to focus the attention on just one other individual (monogamy) so to initiate the process of reproducing \[3].

To date, romantic love isdefined as the pleasurable affection, sexual attraction, and passionate love and sentiment of intimacy shared between two partners wetherlovers orbeloved.

Although writers and philosophers have been in search, and perhaps found, for longer periods of timethe definition and meaning of love, in recents years, otherfields of study have stepped in to try to explain the hidden secretof love. Today, science shares importantevidence onthe definition,causes, and intentions ofromantic love, along withits restless, endless, historicalproperties.

Romantic love defined by science is a property shaped byhistory and development of neuropeptides and neurotransmitters \[2]. Neuroendocrynology has studied the principles behind the acquisition of unpredictable and unprecedentedstatesof emotion driven byoneindividualshift ofbehavior whenexperiencedlove (be in love or be loved) \[2].

As a motivational system (the planning and pursuit of a need or objective), studies have shown that romantic love involves area of the brain associated with motivation and pursue of pre-planned objectives. So the need of taking on risky behavior, conduct that shows euphoria, obsessive thinking, emotional dependence, sexual attraction and possessiveness are all common attitudes that relates to one goal-oriented attitude of the individual that experience this typology of love.

Although romantic love may havedifferent facetsbased on the time therelationship startedbetween the partners, researches haveshown upfront discoveries on the ultimate explanation of romanticlove.

The scientific activity that causes humans to respond in manyways to the feeling and perception of love finds roots in the neurological aspectof aperson’sanatomyand physiology. The early phase of love, that usually arecharacterizebyfeelings of pleasure and searching behaviors of intimacy,revealedtheneurobiological state of the individualsto beextremely proactive and thereforedifferent than a laterphasecompanionship\[2].Indeed, inthe first year into the relationship, complex seriesof computations of the brain that delivers uncontrolled and unexpected behaviors tothe individual show a clear sign of the originoflove\[3].Anxiety, stress, emotional and physical dependence are all part of the signs the individual’s behavior shows and undergoes\[3]. Science steps in and explains carefully demonstrating that human behaviors during relationships have neuroendocrinological precursor.

For example, the hormones of the hypothalamus-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis, studied through magnetic testing(fMRI),involved in the stress response \[4] are important components of love during the first stage of the relation andcan explain the complex abstract lovers’ emotional gestures. In particular, researches show cortisolto be higher in subjects that intend to improve thesocial bonding, social contact, and tenderness of the interaction \[2,5]. The activation of the stress response, expressed by cortisol in high percentage in most cases studied, causesthe physiological adaptations to the stressresponse toincreasesrespiratory rate, metabolism, and cardiovascular tone.

Physiological signs showing off whentwo partners first start to date can beshorten of breath, palpitations, anxiety, euphoria, and astate of awareness.

Theseconditionsare allassociated with the neural and endocrine system function of theindividuals that seem to experience love \[4], wether the feeling comesfrom both or just one of the two

[](<>)[](<>)The early phase of love between two mates is characterized by thecatecholamine (adrenal glands hormone),that functions as a neurotransmitter in the nervous system,norepinephrine that isinvolved in the loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and modification of the individual’s attention activity\[4]seen in the mate, or both mates, who might experiencelove.

Still within this fragment of time of the relationship,recent fMRI visible neuroimagingstudies of romantic love, demonstratedthe role of dopamine, neurotransmitter, as a precursor to regulate the individual’ssexual response,the feeling of pleasure, acquire reward,focused attention and other physiological stimuli part of the first years of the relationship \[1,2,6].Those stimuli have been proven to be alsoassociated with traits linked withabuse and behavioraladditions, such as tobacco, cannabis, and alcohol \[1].

The activation of the ventral tegmental area (VTA)(a structure found in the midbrain region) was clearly visible, in studies conducted also withfMRI where several and different (in age and experience) individuals were tested, and the linkageof it with romantic love was again proven right.It appears to date, that the VTA activeness is present in the early stage of the relationship but also later on over the years (28 months) \[2].

The VTA region is part of the central region of the brain’s reward system and indeed seems to be highly triggered when the action of love takes place.Dopamine(DA)and specific pathways (dopaminergic pathways) appear to be critical to the mechanism that involvespleasure, strong motivation to succeed, passion, despair, and painful memories\[1,2,6].The studies have therefore shown the important linkage between romantic love and the crave for a reward clearly visible in most relationship, especially nowadays.

In the first years into the relation, dopamine plays a role in the sexual activity and thatcan serve as an important actto ensuretrue love to bestrong and everlastingthroughoutlife.Moreover, theincreasing level of testosterones and estrogen activity can increase the release of dopamine that additionally can elevate sexual arousal and steroids \[2].

It is of certain importance now to introduce to this incredible mixture of neuropeptides and hormones activitydiscourse the role of testosterone and estrogen. Testosterone, steroid hormone of the male characteristic system, role the amygdala lateral hypothalamus system’s activity which enhances vasopressin, anancientpeptide molecule pivotal in the action of defense, aggression, attachment and love \[7].Lately, studies appeared to provevasopressin(VP) and oxytocin (OT) being fundamental for body adaptation to emotional situations and romantic attachment \[2,7]. The importance of oxytocin being in the presence of the other peptide VP, at times also DP, to favor social behavior and emotional experiences, such as pair bond and sexual behavior, is critical importance as it turns the relationship intoa successful mating process \[1,2,6,7].

In this last explanation of science being in “romantic” love, the components of action between DP, OT, and VP are fundamental for strengthen the relation and make that last over long periods of time.

Several brain regions are demonstrated to be also triggered by the motivational system of love, and those are the caudate nucleus (located into the lateral ventricle area of the brain) that plays a role in reward detection and expectations, the ventral pallidum (located in the basal ganglia of the brain) that plays a role in regulating feelings of attachment,and the insular cortex (portion of the cortex found within the lateral sulcus of the brain) that engages the feeling of pain with the overall sensation of love \[1,2,5,6].

To conclude, it is sustained that love is a yet undiscovered unpredictable sum of events that shifts from emotionsto all types of feelings. Expert in the fields of poetry,philosophy, and other artistic studies may argue that there has not been a clear explanation to what romantic love actuallymeans and accomplishes.

It has been restated that hormones, such as testosterone which plays an important role in sexual craving behaviors and cortisol which dictates principles of attraction, peptides, such as VP and OX which arefundamental for individual’s arouse of feelings of attachment, and otherbrain areas such asthe VTA, the amygdala, the ventral pallidum, thecaudate nucleus, and the insular cortex which areall important associated mediators ofromantic love, help to draw aconnection line betweenscience and love showing unique prospective and approach to that.

However,it isfascinating to seehow the human brain responds every time the action oflove takes place; how it makes individualsfeel the pleasureof a call, the madness of a forgotten message, the urge of a talk, and the sufficient sick need of attention from that partner so obstinately desired.

With this reading, it is seen that romantic love is amotivation. It is a need. It is an addition, perhaps. However, romantic love arose through history fromantecedent individual’sexperiences and concerns, as it is shown to have similarities in the way the biological mechanism of attraction work in mammalians.

Science has lately stepped in and debated the since then undebatable topic of romantic love. So as far as science is concerned, romantic loveis not a simple infatuation, but a mixture of collective neuroendocrinological activities, of properties that perfectly fits within one individual’s lifespan to make sure love dwells.



– It has tobe remembered that the situation, which described above was the linkage of a scientific reasoning with love,can varybetween the partner who is male and the one who isfemale.--
