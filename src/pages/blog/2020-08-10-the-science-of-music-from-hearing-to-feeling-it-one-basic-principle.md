“*As I come across music, I come across Charles Darwin. What I have taking placein my ears going into my mind makes the reading be just a small piece of surrounding besides my opened window and trees outside. And the sound still endows shades as well as sun rays of pleasant and unpleasant emotions. When Darwin sustained that “music was known and understood before words were spoken” I thought that a reason I could feel this happiness running up my body, andat this point, couldnot be provoked by much more than seven notes played mysteriously together. In muchvarying andcontinuous patterns that after 40 000 years still find simplicity in many persons’ physical gestureand mental emotions, music is beauty, an ignite of intellect and moral activitythat just pushesbiological factors to take place. May be music a simplistic cultural product or a leisure activity to some individuals, perhaps? Evolution to growth of people hearing music as well as the feeling of it perceived on a work out trip may respond to this question differently thanmany of you.”*

If science is an intrinsic mysterious tool, than music is indeed nothing but a ubiquitous biologicalcultural product of science in terms of mankind evolutionand existence. If anthropology (biological and cultural) as well as archeology, cognitive psychology and developmental neurology are the all means of conceptualizing musicality(the interpersonal dependent capacity to connect human behaviors toward one reciprocated shared brain stimulus and thus emotion)known today, than music can be“notoriously difficult do define”(Iain Morley 149) indeed.       Music has physical and mental capacitiesto lever pleasant and unpleasant emotions to people conscious, even though varying from culture to culture andacross oceans into lands of more remote regions on earth. Music shares commonalities, however, to one’s person behavior and response to the triggeredstimulus.

History comes by mandatorily to tell that evolution matters when human vocal expression and gesture stared first to come out on hearth about 40 000 years ago, about 150 000 years after the first Homo sapiens appeared, and perhapsmore than that \[1]. To tell what music is hence today, an emotional caused human concern to consume responses in facing the outside world and specific circumstances, there is aneed to start from thebehavioral evolutionary evidence of thehuman’sfirstvocalization appearanceand pursuit.                                               First communications among first specieson earth developed and determined what mankind canhear in modern days. “Vocal tonal abilities, speech, and other forms of vocal communication”(Morley 152)developed to go to embrace human relationships as well as emotions. Muscular and vocal movements were key evolutionary factors to human perception of music \[1].

To hear music in the first place requireda collaborative connection with human history andvocal components. The ability to produce sound in any controllable and more variated way now arethe consequence of theprocessed evolution of the vocal tract, alsopresent inall primates back in time \[1]. Predecessor of humans same genusindeedshared anatomical similarities as those developed throughout time. The larynx anatomy and physiology modified and indicatedearlier than any other anatomical structure the ability to perfectthe distribution of soundacross the vocalapparatus. “A lower resting laryngeal position and increased supra-laryngeal sound space” (Morley 153)were the earlier modification noticed \[1].Successively, neurological modifications occurred to improve airflow within the laryngeal tractwhich allowed a possible potential variation and control of the intensity of sound and pitch \[1].The thoracic evolution of the human specie innervated in turn to completion allowing the acquisition of a more controlled practice over the vocal activity as well as an improvement in the hyoid (bone situated in the neck which confers structure to tongue and other muscle in the oral cavity) location.

About 1 million of years ago, the crucial physical process of anatomic and physiologic concern andmodification occurred to be fundamentallyimportantto the process of hearing (and therefore music).The developed vocal structure seen prior to modern years sharedsimilarities and gavereasons to believe in a further and constant improvement where comparative studies of neurological structures and fissile evidence stilltodayhighlightthe facts even clearer \[1].

As for the vocal tract, brain regions grew concurrently by morphology and cranialdimensionand shared important evidence too of the benefits toward the effectiveness of the communication and manipulation of the vocalwork,as well as for the benefit of hearing. The sensory parietal lobe, regions behind the frontal lobe, shares patterns ofmodificationover time as well as the prefrontal cortex region and theBroca’s area (frontal lobe area) \[1].The reason by whichmankindengages at times in deep state of emotions is sustained to be of neurological concern and the enunciated above thesis can substantiate that.

It is indeed proven that the pattern of speaking correlates to the one of hearing, and vice versa. So the development seen antecedent modern days in terms of vocal tract and brain structures links to the astonishing modern day’s capacity of listening to music effectively enough to provoke physical and mental human responses to the environment. Studies conducted recently have supported evidence regarding the triggered pattern of emotions that hearing sound causes to human biochemical activity. 

Cerebral blood flow (CBF), to date, still is a tool used to examine patients responses to the hearing of music when taking part of sample inscientifictrials. It is indeed shown the correlation between the areas enunciated above, prefrontal regions development, to the evidence claimed by the neuropsychology /cognitive neuroscience department at McGills University, Montreal, Canada which agrees to the thesis \[2]:the limbic (system which takes part in many mental and physicalhuman actions such as sexual behaviors, social behaviors, emotional reactions, memory and motivation etc.,) and neocortical(limbic system regions, such as subcallosa area, para-hippocampus gyrus, and gyrus cinguli) classificationareas were seen to be actively participating in the response to the hearing of sound, such as when music played\[2].

Into details of the results, specific areas demonstrated actual activation during the testpositron emission tomography (PET-a measure of cell in body tissue where biochemical activities can take place) CBS to music stimuli\[2]. Following, the list to which each area shown was highlighted and the associationwith mental and physical human successive reaction isprovided for better understanding:\[2,5,6,7]

* Right para-hippocampus gyrus

  \-cognitive processes

  \-viso-spatial processing (to recognize place of objects in the surroundings)

  \- memory for objects and spacial configuration
* Precuneus region:

  \- memory and recollection of information and integration

  \- perception of the environment and reactivity to respond to it

  \- mental imagery strategy and response to pain
* Cingulate-subcallosa (anterior)

  \- amygdala and hypothalamus

  \- relation to emotion and its effects to internal and external stimuli

  \- endocrine responses, such as pain perception and motor movements

  \- aspects of cognition



From the data gathered above, the connection of people hearing soundto the actualfeeling ofit happening is automatic. Less clear can still be said aboutthe full understanding of the process of evolution to which theconnection was tried to enunciate.To evolve up to today’s date, the vocal connection to the hearing activity still iscrucial \[1]. Vocal structures, such as muscles and bones, which co evolved with the one seen in the hearing system showed phenomenalworkbut also incredible results.

To date, to claim that voice developed prior of hearing is simple which reading it may be even redundant and obvious to most of you. However, language was not. Gesture as well as musicality drove the successfulmankind tocompatiblyspeak to one another. Sound (music)therefore can be said to be paying back a favorand, as well as laryngeal and pharyngeal muscles development, the way people communicate nowadays is also thank to part of that development and connection\[3]. In this case for music,itenhancespeople’s feelings to a higher state, stronger and reinforced, wether they are positive or negative \[3]. Here, the subjective content is key to that reinforcement and a necessity for the listener to engage with music enough to embracethat change offeelings\[3].

The connection of music to human ancestors and primates remains a secret and mystery still not fully unfolded and comprehended. The connection of voice and hearing remains clear, however, and positively substantiated by science evidence and absolute truths.

Music is not more than a confined series of notes coagulating together to harmonically engage listeners and surrounding elements to feel and appreciate. The action of hearing shows changing in people’s body and mind, and that is enough to answer the infinite power thata song both in times of bloom and doom can cause. Wether an individual and beloved flies away and cry, music can tell to feel and let go. To work out without music can be painful or a moment of relaxation. Andafter all it seems to be not up to people deciding if music can be goodor not.

“*Evolution tells that humans were not listeners before speakers and development and pressure caused modification soto tellto bethe way mankind is today in relation to music.Music provides and never takes, and that is sure thing. Music is therapy, both metaphorically and not, to the extent that can facilitate recovery and improve physical movement. Disorder is ordered with music, and order is transformedwithin music. Lets always keep that in mind. Music and sound more generally will always be so strongly rooted within mankind that will hardly fade away.”*
