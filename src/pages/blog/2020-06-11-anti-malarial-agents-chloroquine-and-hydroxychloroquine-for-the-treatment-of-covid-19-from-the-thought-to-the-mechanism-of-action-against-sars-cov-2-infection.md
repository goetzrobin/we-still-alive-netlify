description: >-
  Recent studies disclosed at the beginning of March of this year had seemed to
  recognize the mechanism of Chloroquine (CQ), the drug most prone to succeed in
  the fight against the malaria disease as well, as potential candidates for the
  successful treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infection.

  It is intended here to address the mechanism of CQ applied to the treatment of the malaria disease and to give clarity to the developing research of CQ used in the fight against COVID-19.

“And I could see with my eyes, when I was working in Kawangware, one of the biggest slum areas in Kenya, many sick people diagnosed with the malaria disease coming into the clinic. There were no signs of frustration, unhappiness, of pain the behavior shown was silent to their same breath just one step away from sorrow.”

Malaria is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Kenya \[2], according to the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey released in 2014. However, the entire Kenyan area is not the only African region struck by this deadly disease. To date, malaria has reached a global-scale impact, and that was suggested by the rising of deaths caused by the parasite each year all around the world (Southeast Asia, Oceania, South America also)\[3,4].

The parasite known as Plasmodium falciparum (the parasite that causes the malaria disease) is the only one in the position to significantly cause a risk of death to the person infected, as the parasite invades erythrocytes (the red blood cells) in the bloodstream host and produces parasitemias (the presence of the parasite in the blood).

The chloroquine’s mechanism of action against malaria is, to a certain extent, straightforward. The main principle of CQ studied about the malaria disease resides in its chemical characteristic as a diprotic (the capacity to accept two hydrogen ions) weak base \[3]. The capacity to raise the pH of the food vacuole of the parasite allows the inhibition of the replication factor of asexual (sexual and erythrocytic hepatic parasites do not cause symptoms thus potential damage to the host cells) parasites in the host’s bloodstream. In actuality, the study, which is referred to here is the explanation of the antimalarial drug, demonstrates that chloroquine raises intravesicular pH in the parasite and inhibits its growth within the erythrocyte’s host.

Moreover, CQ shows other mechanisms that, based upon the same principle of being a weak base, inhibits intracellular targeting and membrane movement, and as well inhibiting the transfer of hemoglobin to the food vacuole, with the final objective to stop Plasmodium falciparum’s growth \[3].
More recent documented studies provided in research \[3] substantiated that the thesis expressed above is indeed accurate. The molecular basis of chloroquine action has also been understood to take place in the hemozoin crystal formation to cause the detoxification of the parasite Plasmodium falciparum\[4].To survive, the malaria parasite accumulates the toxic products into crystals to assure its survival. In a more complex cascade of events than enunciated here, CQ interrupts the completion of that process facilitating the death of the parasite.

Even though the dependent, consistent use of CQ to cure patients bitten by a female mosquitos Anopheles(the only infected mosquito the causes malaria)have caused over time the parasite to develop into a more resistant copy of itself to the same drug (a chloroquine-resistant malaria parasite)\[4], the medical treatments of malaria followed own developments additionally, and to date, the most recent studies provide an optimistic perspective to the restless fight at the disease \[4].

The mechanism to which chloroquine operates as an effective anti-malarial medication cannot interfere, at least to a certain extent, with the emergent properties encountered for the treatments of other pathogenic effects on humans, such as viral or carcinogenic activities \[4]. For the treatments of autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis as well, the administration of antimalarial drugs CQ and HCQ, structurally different from CQ due to the introduction of a hydroxyl group into the aminoquinoline CQ molecular formula, have been used in the last decades.
It is evident that the range of effects of those aminoquinoline drugs is more than one, and that the effects that CQ and HCQ have on the pathogenic parasite that causes malaria are different than the one encountered in the cure of other patient’s diseases.

The sickness originated from the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the treatment with CQ and HCQ is one of the latest arguments regarding this phenomenon.
In patients affected with COVID-19, the use of CQ and HCQ as medication to treat the disease has been recently studied. However, the mechanism of actions are mostly different than what applied in the cure of patients with malaria, few potential connection and properties share common factors between the two pathologies. One of the chemical characteristics that still drives both diseases to share a common therapeutic agent is the aminoquinoline’s weak base condition \[5].

As weak bases (a chemical property of specific molecules in a solution that allows the raising of pH of organelles in human bodies cell, such as lysosomes in this case), CQ and HCQ have been proven to show desired (optimistic) effects to the fight against this year’s coronavirus \[5] as capable to rise the endosomal pH and inhibit fusion of SARS-CoV-2 and the host cell membrane \[8]. Besides this condition, other linkages were not found between the two diseases and treatments.

However, CQ and HCQ were studied and proven to be potentially able to inhibit the coronavirus entry into the human respiratory tract by changing the mechanism (glycosylation) of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptor protein structure, function, and stability \[5]. In both cases, the use of CQ and HCQ had shown signs of efficacy control of inhibition to the entry and post-entry steps of the SARS-CoV-2 into the patient’s respiratory tract \[5].
Additionally, the biochemical mechanism considered functionally important in the antiviral response against the SARS-CoV-2 infection is known as the immunomodulatory action of the drugs, both for CQ and HCQ. Immunoregulator actions were not hypothesized and visible to be directly correlated with the treatment of malaria, on the other hand \[5].

The last mechanism of action of CQ and HCQ has been studied in the activity of mice. In studies, in vitro (outside the living organism), CQ and HCQ were demonstrated to show correlated efficacy in the treatment of coronaviruses, such as coronavirus OC43, and a type of influenza A. To be reminded, the use of aminoquinolines as pharmacologic therapy to treat acute virus infections was not first applied against the COVID-19 disease \[6].

Therefore, it was hypothesized that the treatment against the COVID-19 with CQ, and eventually HCQ, could lead to a potential therapy to the disease \[6]. However, it has remained, that the most recent studies have provided no sufficient reasons to substantiate the correlation of HCQ and CQ with the successful recovery of patients affected by COVID-19. The studies offered about the use of these drugs, also by researches in French and China (Shanghai), have shown a lack of findings and have noted difficulties in the interpretation of data \[7]. Although being found to directly interfere in the antiviral activity of SARS-CoV-2 and being a successful anti-inflammatory agent to contribute to attenuate the inflammatory response in vitro of the disease, more clinical trials and confirmations are required.

According to the National Institute of Health (NIH) on the latest news about potential antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 (June 11, 2020), it was recommended against the use of CQ and HCQ for the treatment of the disease caused by coronavirus 2020, except in clinical trials \[8].

With this thesis, it was certainly possible to assess the highly astatic factors that take place every day in the fight against COVID-19. With CQ and HCQ, there was given a chance here to dive into the specificity of the mechanism of action to find linkages between the therapy against malaria and the one cure of patients against COVID-19.

To give one last information from the National Institute of Health research against the COVID-19, the latest, 11 June 2020, update claims that “there are no Food and Drug Administration- (FDA) approved drugs for the treatment of COVID-19” \[8]. Data on the safest and most effective way to treat patients affected by the disease are starting to emerge \[8]. However, as for any type of viral disease, “treatment decisions ultimately reside with the patient and their health care provider.”

Remdesivir is the latest antiviral agent recommended by the NIH for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients which suffer from specific conditions (aggravated stage of the disease).

“Today far away from what can be seen in that clinic just outside of Kawangware, I have much to think of. The conditions I could see patients with malaria were a life-changing event, to me. As I think of it I remind myself of the virus we all struggle with at this point. I do see frustration, unhappiness, and pain. I see sorrow this time also, but I find peace in the memories I still have in my head of what today’s feelings are about in the faces of who I saw in Kawangware back at that time.”

\----- Observations through researches highlighted in this text have suggested that the action of HCQ and CQ can appear to be different in certain aspects \[5]. It is important to remind the readers that, as the references on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine used in this text may be easily confused as they may apply to certain actions and categories and not.
It should also be noted that the readings provided as references in this text vary in dates received, revised, and published. So, it must be understood that the enunciated above information may vary over time and therefore contradict certain hypotheses made in this brief article.-----
