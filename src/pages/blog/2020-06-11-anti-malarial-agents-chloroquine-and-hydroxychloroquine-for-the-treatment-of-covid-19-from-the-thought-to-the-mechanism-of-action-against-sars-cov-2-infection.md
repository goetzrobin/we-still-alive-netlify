  Treatment of COVID-19: From the Thought To the Mechanism of Action against
  SARS-CoV-2 infection"

  Recent studies disclosed at the beginning of march this year had seemed to
  recognize the mechanism of Chloroquine (CQ) and one of its derivative
  Hydroxychloroquine(HCQ), structurally different from CQ due to the
  introduction of a hydroxyl group into the aminoquinoline CQ molecular formula,
  as potential candidates for the successful treatment against SARS-CoV-2
  infection.


  Over time, the discourse upon which the debate has raised of Chloroquine being one of the agents by definition most prone to succeed in the fight against the malaria disease and its potential to successfully win the fight against the COVID-19 disease additionally was recently on everyone’s lips.


  Also, due to the discourse being involved with newspaper all around the world for one President of the United States’s statement in support of HCQ against SARS-CoV-2, a “game changer” sustained by him [1], it is intended here to address the debate enunciated above and to give clarity to the developing research of chloroquine, and its derivative HCQ, used in the fight against COVID-19 [1].

“And I could see with my eyes, when I was working in Kawangware,one of the biggest slum area in Kenya, many sick people diagnose with the malaria disease coming into the clinic. Helpless. Hopeless. There were no signs of frustration, unhappiness, of pain the behavior shown was silent to their same breath just one step away from sorrow”

Malaria is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Kenya \[2], according to the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey released in 2014. However, the entire Kenya area is not the only African region struck by this deadly disease. To date, malaria has reached a global-scale impact, and that was suggested by the rising of deaths caused by the parasite each year all around the world (Southeast Asia, Oceania, South Americaalso)\[3,4].

The parasite known as *Plasmodium falciparum (*the parasite that causes the malaria disease)is the only one in the position to significantly cause a risk of death to the person infected, as the parasite invade erythrocytes (the red blood cells) in the blood stream host and produces parasitemias (the presence of parasite in the blood).

The chloroquine’s mechanism of action against malaria is, to a certain extent, straightforward. The main principle of CQ studied in the relation with the malaria disease resides in its chemical characteristic as a diprotic (the capacity to accept two hydrogen ions)weak base \[3]. The capacity to rise the pH of the food vacuole of the parasite allows the inhibition of the replication factor of asexual (sexual and erythrocytic hepatic parasites do not cause symptoms thus potential damage to the host cells) parasites in the host’s blood stream. In actuality, the study to which is referred here the explanation of the antimalarial drug demonstrates that chloroquine raises intravesicular pH in the *parasite* and inhibits its grow within the erythrocyte’s host.

Moreover, CQ shows other mechanisms that, base upon the same principle of being a weak base, inhibit intracellular targeting and membrane movement,and as well inhibit the transfer of hemoglobin to the food vacuole, with the final objective to stop *Plasmodium falciparum*’s growth \[3].

More recent documented studies than provided in research \[3] substantiated the thesis expressed above. The molecular basis of chloroquine action has also been considered to take place in the haemozoin crystal formation to cause the detoxification of the parasite *Plasmodium falciparum* \[4]*.*To survive indeed, the malaria parasite accumulates the toxic products into crystals to assure its survival. In a more complex cascade of events than enunciated here, CQ interrupts the completion of that process facilitating the death of the parasite.

Even though the dependent, consistent use of CQ to cure patients bitten by female mosquitos *Anopheles* (the infected only mosquito the causes malaria)have caused over time the parasite to develop into a more resistant copy of itself to the same drug (a chloroquine-resistant malaria parasite)\[4], the medical treatments of malaria followed own development additionally, and to date, most recent studies provide anoptimistic prospective to the restless fight at the disease \[4].

\------

The mechanism to which chloroquine operates as an effective anti-malarial medication cannot interfere, at least to a certain extent, with the emergent properties encountered for the treatments of other pathogenic effects, such as viral or carcinogenic activity \[4]. For the treatments of autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis as well, the administration of antimalarial drugs CQ and HCQ have been seen at use in the last decades.Therefore, the range of effects of those aminoquinoline drugs are multiple, and it is evident that the effects that CQ and HCQ have on the pathogenic parasite that causes malaria are different than the one encountered in the cure of other patient’s diseases, such as the one originated from the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

In patients affected by COVID-19, and the use of CQ and HCQ as medication to treat them, the mechanism of actions are, still to a certain extent, different than what is applied in the cure of patients with malaria. However, one of the chemical characteristic that still drives both diseases to share a common therapeutic agent is the aminoquinoline’s weak base condition\[5].

As weak bases (a chemical property of specific molecules in a solution) that specifically allows the raising of pH of organelles in human bodies cell, such as lysosomes, in this case, CQ and HCQ have been proven to show desired (optimistic) effects to the fight against this year’s coronavirus \[5]. Additionally, CQ was studied and proven to be potentially able to inhibit the coronavirus entry into human respiratory track by changing the mechanism (glycosylation) of ACE 2 receptor protein structure, function, and stability \[5]. In both the use of CQ and HCQ, there has been shown sign of efficacy control of inhibition to the entry and post-entry steps of theSARS-CoV-2 into the patients respiratory track \[5].

Also, the biochemical mechanism considered functionally important in the antiviral response against the SARS-CoV-2 infection is known as the immunomodulator action of the drugs, both for CQ and HCQ. Immunoregulator actions were not hypothesized to be directly correlated with the treatment of malaria, on the other hand \[5].

CQ and HCQ activity in mice in studies in vitro (outside the living organism) were demonstrated to show correlated efficacy in the therapeutic treatment of coronaviruses, such as coronavirus OC43, and a type of influenza A, so to say that this was not the first time in trying to use this pharmacologic therapy to treat acute virus infections \[6].

Therefore, it was hypothesized that the treatment against the COVID-19 with CQ, and eventually HCQ, could lead to a potential therapy to the disease \[6]. However, it has to be remained, that the most recent studies have provided no sufficient reasons to substantiate the correlation of HCQ and CQ with the success recovery of patient affected by COVID-19.

The studies offered, also by researches in French and China (Shanghai), have shown lack of findings and have noted difficulties in the interpretation of data \[7]. The analysis considered in this text according with \[7] examined in a large medical center in New York City, highlighted indeed the fact that there is not direct correlation between intubation or death of patients with the pathology indicated and the use of HCQ specifically \[7]. In this research cited above to which is related here the thesis accordingly, there is no citation of CQ being used. 

So, with \[7],It was surely possible to asses the highly astatic factors that takes place every day in the fight agains the COVID-19. With CQ and HCQ, there was given a chance here to dive into the specificity of the mechanism of action to find reasons to believe in a potential therapy to cure patients at mostly acute stages of the disease.

However being found to directly interfere in the antiviral activity of SARS-CoV-2 and being a successful anti inflammatory agent to contribute therefore to attenuate the inflammatory response in vitro of the disease, more clinical trials and confirmations are required.

\------\
Observations through researches highlighted in this text have suggested that the action ofHCQ and CQ can appear to be different in certain aspect \[5]. It is important to remind the readers that, as the references on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine used in this text may be confused by you as they may apply to certain action and categories or not. 

It is to be highlighted also that readings provided as references in this text vary in dates received, revised, and published. So, it must be understood that the enunciated above data may change over time and therefore contradict certain hypothesis that were made  in this brief article .
