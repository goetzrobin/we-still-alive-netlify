The sun hits hard to my skin and head directly. The dry air over the summertime requires water. To me, here, this source of hydration is not easy to get access to. And I start to wonder what people can drink to survive the harsh environment and climate conditions. I see that as well as sun rays, the land gives off heat, and the warm weather perceived is even hotter than expected. Water is a requirement for survival, essential for every human being living around the world, even where I first realize that besides being a necessity and body requisite for survival, in Kawangware, Kenya, to have water is not granted, and the supply coverage of it, it is extremely low compared to the total amount of people living in the state. To have water is therefore a privilege, and still being a fixable circumstance, about 1 million people, specifically children, all over the world die every year due to this water crisis and situation. With water, sanitation follows to be one of the most important and tragic health crisis of the 20th century in the developing world.

In Kawangware, a western area outside of Nairobi, Kenya, water, and its supplier and sources are not yet directly available and accessible to the community. Water sources and suppliers are mostly insufficient, unaccessible, and expensive for the average individual living in this area. As well as water, sanitation, “the means of collecting and disposing of excreting and community liquid wastes in a hygienic way as not to endanger the health of the individuals and the community as a whole” according to the World Health Organization (WHO), is the second leading cause of morbidity and mortality and health crisis in the developing world, particularly in locations of the African continent. Angola, Burkina Faso, Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Mauritania, Madagascar, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and particularly Ethiopia, are indeed by country, at the lowest level of the water supply and sanitation chain in comparison with other African countries and the entire world \[2]. Kenya has arisen from a past of secular sorrow and, as far as sanitation is concerned, the situation is changing in the better.

Water supply and sanitation are of crucial importance for humanity do grow and a reason for it to evolve, therefore. They are both fundamental to people as they can help, if supported properly, to shorten the span of common infections, accelerate recovery, prevent early death, and extend the population lifespan \[5 Vaclav Smil]. However, about 17 percent and 41 percent of people living on earth respectively do not have access to water and sanitation \[3].

To raise awareness of the magnitude and severity related to this global phenomenon of water scarcity and insufficient sanitation, about 1.1 billion individuals are without improved water and 2.6 billion without improved sanitation \[3]. About 5000 people, mostly children, die every day from diseases caused by lack of sanitation and affordable, accessible, clean water \[3].

In this location, when I used to work in Kawangware, I could see with my own eyes that to be true. To see children dying is not common and particularly acceptable, and those events have been of crucial importance and a life-changing event. Here, individuals living in Kawangware do not have access to drinkable clean water and adequate personal hygiene. Particularly for children under 3 to 5 years of age, where they do not have solid efficient immunity to fight back the pathogens found in dirty contaminated water, this can turn out to be extremely risky and deadly. Children born in these areas unfairly have to grow up in poverty, where the levels of self-care and health care are preposterously low, and to change in the better is a chance that many do not get.

Most of them suffer from preventable and treatable pathologies, such as diarrhoeal disease. And if we take some time to think of all of that, it is difficult to imagine modern progress when people still die from diarrhea. We live indeed in an era where we have grown so far apart from what means equity and equality that absurdly there can be still found people that die from treatable diseases. To be precise, 1.7 billion cases of childhood diarrhoeal disease are diagnosed every year and about 525 000 children under five years of age die (still each year) from this again treatable and preventable disease \[1].

In Kenya, to date, according to the UNICEF survey conducted in the year 2000, the total supply of water coverage reaches about 49 percent of the entire country, although improved by 9 percent from the year 1990. The total sanitation coverage on the other hand has been higher than most of the African countries with 86 percent in the year 2000. This last analysis is auspicious for the whole of the individuals living in this area, about 30.080 (thousands), as there is still room for improvements to improve health care settings, the standard of hygiene in public spaces, and food security and malnutrition.

However, the water source issue in this area still threaten and therefore can be considered a health crisis. The inappropriate and contaminated supply and purity of the water (clean water) remain a real threat to local families and most children that seem to suffer from it the most. “The inadequate and unsanitary disposal of infected human feces leads to the contamination of the ground and of sources of water,” says the WHO, and this causes a great number of diseases to develop and transmit to the local population. The communicable and noncommunicable diseases are the closest related form of the diseases that derive mostly from the lack of support of clean water in the area \[4]. 

The major communicable diseases known are intestinal infections and helminth infestations, such as cholera, typhoid and paratyphoid fevers, dysentery, and diarrhea disease.

The main source of getting the diarrhea disease resides in the contamination indeed of water with human feces present for example in latrines, sewage, and places were also animals can defecate \[4]. The common pathogens that can cause these intestinal infections are bacteria, for example, Escherichia Coli, that causes indeed the diarrhoea disease, and Salmonella typhi, that causes typhoid, and also viruses, such as poliovirus, that causes the poliomyelitis infection, and the Rotaviruses, that causes enteritis infections\[4]. It has to be reminded that other circumstances can lead to the contraction of such infections and diseases, such as malnutrition and lack of personal hygiene. 

Non-communicable disease is also part of a possible way to contract intestinal infections and those depend on the chemical composition of the wastewater and the accumulation of nitrate in both surface and this binary compound \[4]. The increase of nitrate indeed relates to poor sanitation and is a determinant to develop illnesses of such septic form and severity.

So, diarrhoeal disease is, to date, one of the leading causes of death in children under a certain year of age. Other diseases derive from the same scope and cause water impurity, insanity, and sanitation. However, they are not fundamental here to understand that the crisis is more real and actual than ever before. Again, preventable and treatable diseases such as diarrhoeal disease are still forms for excellence to which about millions of people can die each year. Water supply, excreta disposal systems, and successively health-related diseases need attention and adequate consideration fo addresses the crisis and solves the problem. “All the conditions that affect health, especially with regards to dirt and infection and specifically to the drainage and disposal of sewage and refuse from houses” refer to the sanitation status, according to the WHO. So, disposal methods and wellness in the sector of existing local sanitation requires improvements.

In Kawangware, as in many other areas around the world (Asia, South America) water services also need careful attention. Water needs to be available in the cleanest way to local communities, especially in families with numerous members within it and needs to be delivered safely and in the total respect of the environment (sustainability) and should be constantly visited and inspected \[6]. According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), special care must be taken to check the reliability of groundwater to find reasons to believe it can be drinkable, for instance \[3]. Bacterial contamination can be presented in high depth pipeline and as well as nitrate concentration \[4].

The solutions to the water issue and sanitation health crisis are more complex and surely will require time. Improving water means indeed to facilitate access to household connections, public standpipes, rainwater collection, boreholes, and protected wells \[3], so it is more complex than expected. Improving sanitation means on the other hand to better connect public sewers and septic systems, and improve pour-flush and pit latrines \[3], so as well as water, the circumstances that involve a solution to sanitation issues are more complicated than possibly imagined so far. Sustainability is also a key component in the implementation of optimal sanitation and water successful outcomes, so that must also be remembered.

To conclude, to date, the most objective, also of the website and foundation *WeStillAlive*, present in the area of Kawangware, Kenya, correlates to the water scarcity with the water quality conditions. The latest intentions are to prioritize water supply but also favor a quality that still meets the average standards of water purity. The WHO has tried to “incorporate water efficiency into water programming to address scarcity” \[3] by “look\[ing] at the behavior and lifestyle change of the population \[under consideration]” \[3]. Additionally, the WHO has tried to improve infrastructures and repair water pipes brakes, and also follow up with enhancing agricultural stability \[3]. Improvements have been seen over time since 1990 to still 2000, so there were significant developments in the fields mentioned above. And more seems yet to come.

Sanitation improvements see new upfront discoveries in the wastewater treatment service. Ecological toilets seem to be the future in terms of modified waterborne sewerage as they do not require water to proceed. This seems to be a solution, as there are side effects to which the economic and labor respectively potentials and quality of work still can cause limitations to bring those ideas to concrete physical realities.

When I first saw children drinking from the same location they would pee, I started to think carefully about what was happening in front of me every day I would go to work and see that. Something was not feeling the way it was supposed to be. Today, I think about the possibilities of how, in 2020, there can still be people that have no access to drinkable pure water and still can pathologically be infected severely enough to contract now preventable and treatable diseases, such as the diarrhoeal disease. And I think that that has to change. We all need that change, for the best of our world community as well as the overall health of the human being.

Water security and sanitation in the developing world still cause millions of millions of people to develop sicknesses now preventable and to die from it, indeed. There is the urge to help and to take on actions seriously and immediately.

The area of Kawangware needs particular attention, as well as many other regions all over the world affected by this same phenomenon, as there can be chances for families and mothers particularly to see their child live longer than them. However, about 5000 children every day do not see their mothers growing older, and their mums indeed still do not believe they could see their child passing away before them.
